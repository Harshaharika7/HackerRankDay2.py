# 📘 Day 2: Operators - HackerRank 30 Days of Code

## 🏁 Objective
Learn to use **arithmetic operators** in Python to perform basic calculations.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

You are given:
- `meal_cost`: the base cost of a meal (float)
- `tip_percent`: the percentage of the meal cost to be added as tip (int)
- `tax_percent`: the percentage of the meal cost to be added as tax (int)

Your task is to:
1. Calculate the **tip** and **tax**
2. Add them to the `meal_cost`
3. **Round** the result to the **nearest integer**
4. Print the **total cost**

## 🧾 Input Format
<meal_cost>
<tip_percent>
<tax_percent>

**Example Input:**
12.00
20
8

**Example Output:**
15

Tip = 20% of 12.00 = 2.40
Tax = 8% of 12.00 = 0.96
Total = 12.00 + 2.40 + 0.96 = 15.36
Rounded = 15

How to Run: Option 1: With input file Create a file named input.txt with the required input and run: python3 operators.py < input.txt

Option 2: Manual input Just run: python3 operators.py
